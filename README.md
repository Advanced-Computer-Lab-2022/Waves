# About The Project

This project is for a university course, alongside this what motivated us to put effort in it is that it enhanced our skills and made us more aware of github and MERN STACK.
## Course 

Advanced Computer Lab (CSEN 704) , Winter 2022.
## Theme 

The theme of the project, is to create a complete Online Learning System, through our website a user can enroll in a course and see his/her progression and take exercises related to the course.
## Overview 

We implement this project following the Agile methodology, as the project is divided into 3 sprints. Each sprint has a specific deadline and a specific amount of time. Through this period , we should deliver fully functioning code with specific System requirements which were function and non-functional.
## Objectives

• Learn how to properly use the Agile Methodology to plan out a project and develop
the software.
• Learn the process of following a given set of System Requirements to develop a
software.
• Learn to research and master the use of the MERN Stack.
• Learn how to work together as a team on GitHub.

## Tools and Frameworks

We use MERN Stack to implement our Website. MERN stands for MongoDB, Express, React, Node.

Frontend :

####React.js : React is a front-end JavaScript library for creating user interfaces using UI components that is free and open-source. Meta and a community of individual developers and businesses support it. React can be used to create single-page or mobile applications as a foundation.

####Bootstrap : Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework for front-end web development that is responsive and mobile-first. It includes design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface elements that are based on CSS and JavaScript.

####MUI : MUI is a React User Interface Library. MUI is a comprehensive, flexible, and easily available library of foundational and advanced components that allows you to create your own design system and construct React apps more quickly.

Backend and Database:

####Node.js : Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.

####Express.js: Express.js or simply Express, is a back end web application framework for Node.js, released as free and open-source software under the MIT License. It is designed for building web applications and APIs. It has been called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js.

####MongoDB: MongoDB is a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas. MongoDB is developed by MongoDB Inc. and licensed under the Server Side Public License.

![PurchaseCourse]- Shows purchase details regarding a course which include the name of the course, its price, discount, and total payment

![Account]- Shows user information and option to update any of his/her information

![AddCourse]- Contains form to add a new course with exercises

![ViewReports]- allows an admin to view all reports regarding courses

![ViewUsers]- different pages that show all corporate trainess, instructors, and admins

![ExerciseSession]- page where the user can solve an exercise 




## Roadmap

on the beginning of every sprint we met, divided the work and divided ourselves into 2 groups, group of 3 and a group of 2 and each member of the group worked in parallel with the other member. we used to join google meetings everyday night for about an hour to follow up with our work and discuss problems and try to solve them. By the end of each sprint we always integrate everything together and make some last changes and submit.
